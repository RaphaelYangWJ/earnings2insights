### **Investment Research Report: Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR)**

**Date:** October 7, 2019
**Focus:** Pre-Q3 2019 Earnings Analysis & Outlook
**Recommendation: Neutral**

### **Executive Summary**

Cullen/Frost Bankers (CFR) has demonstrated consistent and robust organic loan growth through the first half of 2019, a core strength of its business model. However, analysis of the preceding three quarters reveals a sequential softening in key profitability metrics, including Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Return on Average Assets (ROA), partly driven by planned strategic investments. While credit quality saw a notable spike in non-performing assets in Q1 2019, it improved significantly in Q2, suggesting the issue was contained.

Our outlook heading into the Q3 2019 earnings release is **Neutral**. We will be closely watching for stabilization in profitability metrics against known expense headwinds and continued discipline in credit quality management to justify a more positive rating.

### **1. Financial Trends (Q4 2018 - Q2 2019)**

Analysis of the last three reported quarters reveals several key trends:

*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** While YoY growth has been positive, there has been a consistent sequential decline in EPS through the first half of 2019.
    *   **Q4 2018:** $1.82
    *   **Q1 2019:** $1.79
    *   **Q2 2019:** $1.72
*   **Loan Growth:** This remains a primary strength. Management consistently describes growth as balanced and organic, with C&I commitments showing particular strength.
    *   **Q4 2018:** Average loans of $13.9 billion (+8.0% YoY)
    *   **Q1 2019:** Average loans of $14.2 billion (+6.8% YoY)
    *   **Q2 2019:** Average loans of $14.4 billion (+6.2% YoY)
*   **Profitability (ROA):** Return on Average Assets, a key efficiency metric, peaked at the end of 2018 and has since compressed.
    *   **Q4 2018:** 1.48%
    *   **Q1 2019:** 1.48%
    *   **Q2 2019:** 1.40%
*   **Credit Quality:** This has been a key area of volatility. After a strong Q4, Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) saw a significant increase in Q1, which was subsequently brought back down in Q2.
    *   **Non-Performing Assets:**
        *   Q4 2018: $74.9 million
        *   Q1 2019: $97.4 million (a 30% sequential increase)
        *   Q2 2019: $76.4 million (a 22% sequential decrease, returning near Q4 levels)
    *   **Provision for Loan Losses:** The provision has mirrored the NPA trend, increasing sharply to cover the Q1 spike before moderating in Q2. Management noted in Q1 that the provision was "a little bit high."
        *   Q4 2018: $3.8 million
        *   Q1 2019: $11.0 million
        *   Q2 2019: $6.4 million

### **2. Strategic Shifts & Narrative**

The core strategic narrative from management has remained unchanged: a focus on **"consistent balanced loan growth"** and disciplined organic expansion. The execution on loan growth validates this strategy. There has been no indication of a shift towards M&A.

Key strategic initiatives influencing the narrative and results include:
*   **Houston Expansion:** A multi-year plan to open 40 locations over 10 years, with management confirming a projected $0.19 EPS impact for FY 2019.
*   **Brand Building:** Management has highlighted its "Opt For Optimism" initiative, sponsorships with the San Antonio Spurs and Houston Rockets, and the social media buzz around its new San Antonio headquarters as key drivers of brand awareness and customer consideration.
*   **Capital Return:** The company has been actively returning capital to shareholders, utilizing $100 million of its buyback authorization in Q4 2018 and spending the remaining $50 million in Q2 2019.

### **3. Operational Updates**

*   **Expense Management:** Noninterest expense is a critical area to watch. Management provided clear guidance in Q2 that the move to the new San Antonio headquarters would create a significant expense headwind. With only one month of the ~$1 million/month lease expense included in Q2, Q3 results will reflect an **additional ~$2 million** in recurring quarterly expense.
*   **Deposit Management:** While overall deposit volumes have been stable, management has focused on maintaining pricing discipline. In Q1, CFO Jerry Salinas noted they were "not feeling a lot of pressure on the deposit pricing side," having already done the "heavy lifting previously." The operational focus is on attracting new customer relationships to maintain a healthy deposit base.
*   **Credit Risk Management:** The key operational story of 2019 has been the successful management of the credit quality issue in Q1. The ability to lower NPAs by over $21 million in a single quarter (Q2) points to strong internal controls. Management has also noted that when they lose deals, it is more often on structure than on price, reinforcing their disciplined underwriting approach.

### **4. Management Tone & Sentiment**

Across all calls, the tone of CEO Phil Green and CFO Jerry Salinas has been steady, confident, and data-driven. They were direct about the increase in NPAs and provisions in Q1 but presented the figures factually, framing the provision level as "a little bit high" but formulaic. The subsequent improvement in Q2 was presented as a return to norm. This consistency in tone projects stability and confidence in their operational model, even when facing headwinds like margin pressure or temporary credit issues.

### **5. Forward Guidance & Key Questions for Q3 2019**

Management has not provided explicit EPS guidance but has been clear on key expense drivers. The Q3 2019 earnings report will be crucial for clarifying the following points:

1.  **Profitability vs. Expenses:** Can the bank generate enough pre-provision net revenue to offset the known ~$2 million incremental expense from the new headquarters and stabilize EPS and ROA? Continued compression would be a significant concern.
2.  **Loan Growth Sustainability:** Can the bank maintain its impressive ~6% YoY loan growth, or will it begin to slow in a more challenging economic environment?
3.  **Credit Quality Consistency:** Was the Q2 NPA improvement durable? A second consecutive quarter of NPAs in the ~$75 million range would confirm that the Q1 spike was an anomaly.
4.  **Provision Level:** Will the provision for loan losses remain in the moderate $6-7 million range of Q2, or will management signal caution by increasing it? This will be a key indicator of their outlook on portfolio health.
5.  **Net Interest Margin (NIM):** Given management's Q1 commentary about a "relatively stable" outlook, did NIM hold up during Q3 amid a shifting rate environment? Any commentary on deposit pricing pressure will be critical.
